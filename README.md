# House Price Predictions in Nigeria

In this project, we develop a reliable predictive model using the provided dataset. 
The factors influencing house prices are examined and meaningful patterns are discerned in order to construct a robust model capable of producing accurate price predictions. This data-driven solution aims to empower Wazobia Real Estate Limited with informed pricing insights, boost its competitiveness in the market, and ultimately provide enhanced value to its valued customers.

Before running the notebook, please download the dataset and place it in the same directory as this notebook. The data represents various attributes of houses and their corresponding prices.
## Notebook Execution Order
Please execute the cells in the following order:

1. Load and Explore Data: Load the dataset, explore its structure, and perform initial data analysis.

2. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, perform feature engineering if necessary, and prepare the data for modeling.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualize the data to understand the relationships between features and house prices.

4. Model Building: Build and train a predictive model using the preprocessed data.

5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

6. Price Predictions: Use the trained model to make price predictions for new data.

## Step-by-Step Execution
1. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   - Open Google colab and upload the dataset.

2. Cell Execution:
   - Execute each cell in the notebook from top to bottom in sequential order.
   - Cells containing code should be executed to perform data loading, preprocessing, modeling, etc.
   - Markdown cells provide explanations and visualizations to help you understand the process.

3. Expected Outputs:
   - During execution, you will see the output of code cells, such as data summaries, visualizations, and model evaluation results.
   - Successful execution of the last cell will indicate that the model has been trained, evaluated, and is ready for use.
